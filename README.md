# SunsetPredictor
App that predicts sunsets.

The app will alert people as the sunset happens and prompt them to rate it 0 to 10. It will use that data and combine it with a snapshot of the weather conditions. Hopefully with enough data, the app will be able to predict how cool the sunset will be based on the predicted weather conditions.

Use React Native for the app, hopefully some sort of ant file to deploy to a server. Python or Java (or C++) to run the machine learning. SQL to manage the data (??).
